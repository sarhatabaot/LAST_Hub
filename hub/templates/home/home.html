    <h2>LAST Project Hub</h2>

    <p>
      This site serves as a centralized index of software projects used across
      the LAST ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to provide a clear, organized overview of the various tools,
      drivers, services, and infrastructure components that make up the system,
      and to offer direct access to their source repositories.
    </p>

    <h4>How to use this site</h4>

    <p>
      Use the navigation or the Services page to browse projects by category.
      Each card links directly to the corresponding GitHub repository, where
      documentation, source code, and issue tracking are maintained.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site does not duplicate documentation — it is intended to act as a
      stable entry point and overview as the ecosystem evolves. We may eventually add
      additional documentation pages.
