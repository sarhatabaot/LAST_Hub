# Getting ready

A few preliminary steps are essential to run observations from your laptop when you are outside the institute. Please make sure you have
1. VPN access to the WIS Secure network. You must have a VPN access that requires a one-time-password (OTP) generated on your phone via the app RSA authenticator. Any other VPN service from Weizmann might not work.
2. Download NoMachine on your computer.
3. Try to connect to one of the LAST machines (e.g. last0 at 10.23.1.25) with the VPN active and NoMachine.
4. Now that you downloaded Nomachine, don't use it. You can perfectly do your shift using a webbrowser on your computer and ssh to any LAST machine (ocs@10.23.1.1-25). In fact, if you use Nomachine to observe and Enrico discovers it, he will come in trolling, and mess with what you're trying to do.


If you’re having issues connecting, see [HowTo: Connect to LAST on-site machines from remote](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1MPsHfMUXFt2yGROWMPd_39sobSkXLkcAUT1Up_RQBfQ/edit)
