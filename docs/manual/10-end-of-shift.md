# End of shift (sunrise)

The following operations should happen automatically if all is fine, but sometimes it is not, so check. At sunrise, stop observations on each mount using the command from the previous section. Then:
1. Shutdown all mounts.
2. Close Roof and walls.
3. Turn AC on.

If it’s the 5th day, at first lights look to the East. Gandalf should be there with the Rohirrim.
Thanks for your shift and have a good rest!
